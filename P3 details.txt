[12:42 AM, 5/8/2021] Uni Naufil: Hi Muhammad , here is it https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TKOKzHl5RemaFWIz7GFM2Qv6Vylcx9GtkqgByPVDg0Y/edit?usp=sharing
[12:42 AM, 5/8/2021] Uni Naufil: 7th point is excluded
[12:48 AM, 5/8/2021] Uni Naufil: Please stop working on the project that you are working on right now. And start working on this from tomorrow. 

This is a website bot. Rest of the details are in the Google docs. Please deliver this by tomorrow evening. Super easy project. 

Please lead this project. I won't help. You will receive digitalocean and kommunicate credentials of client soon.
[12:51 AM, 5/8/2021] Uni Naufil: You will also receive the Gmail id of client soon, so that you can add him into GitHub repo and also to Google cloud project and dialogflow. Make sure that repo you create is inside the organization that we recently created on GitHub
[12:52 AM, 5/8/2021] Uni Naufil: Have you pushed your last code to the organization?
[12:57 AM, 5/8/2021] Uni Naufil: This is for your help how to handoff conversation to human agent: https://www.kommunicate.io/blog/dialogflow-chatbot-human-handoff/
[1:08 AM, 5/8/2021] Uni Naufil: Goodluck
[1:15 AM, 5/8/2021] Uni Naufil: Also, this is the best time to test how productive you are. Turn on the timer and check how long does it take. Next time when similar project arrives, try to break the record. But above all, make sure bots are robust. Timer is just so you know how long did you take, for your self improvement
